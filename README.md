# A simple Telegram bot

This is a simple Telegram bot created with the ![tutorial here](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Extensions-%E2%80%93-Your-first-Bot).  
Since the tutorial is done in interactive mode, I think a sorted script might help.  
**Do it by yourself first is strongly suggested!**

## bot token

Talk to [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and get your own token.

## config.ini

Replace `{your-token}` with your own token (`'` or `"` is not needed!) and you are good to go!  
Just enter `python3 main.py` and see how amazing your bot is!
